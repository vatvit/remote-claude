title: Remote Claude Web Control
status: proposed
type: epic
epic-name: remote-control
priority: high

## Goal

Create a web-based remote control for Claude Code. A user opens a webpage in their browser, types text commands, and those commands are forwarded to a Claude Code instance running on another PC in the local network.

## Why

Allows controlling Claude Code on a remote machine from any device with a browser on the same WLAN — no SSH, no terminal needed.

## Scope

- Static web UI with chat-style interface (command history, markdown rendering)
- Node.js host server using @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK
- REST API + SSE for streaming responses (start with complete result, add streaming later)
- Single shared session (one Claude conversation at a time)
- Working directory fixed in server config
- Docker-based deployment
- No authentication (local WLAN only)

## Out of Scope

- Authentication / security
- Multiple concurrent sessions
- File upload/download
- OAuth or external integrations

## Success Criteria

- User can open `http://<host-ip>:3000` from any device on WLAN
- User types a command, sees Claude Code's response rendered with markdown
- Conversation history persists during session
- Server runs in Docker on the target PC

## Sub-tasks

- RCL-002: Project scaffolding (Docker, package.json, project structure)
- RCL-003: Host server with Claude Code SDK integration
- RCL-004: REST API endpoints (command, status, stream)
- RCL-005: Static web UI with chat interface
- RCL-006: Markdown rendering and code syntax highlighting
- RCL-007: SSE streaming for real-time responses
