## Description

Set up the project structure, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and package.json.

**Deliverables:**
- `Dockerfile` — Node.js image with project deps
- `docker-compose.yml` — service definition with port mapping and volume mounts
- `host/package.json` — with express and @anthropic-ai/claude-code dependencies
- `web/` directory stub (index.html placeholder)
- Verify: `docker compose up --build` starts without errors

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Which Node.js version to use in Docker?
- Should the host working directory (for Claude Code) be mounted as a volume?
- Port mapping: 3000 internal → 3000 external, or different?
