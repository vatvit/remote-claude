## Description

Create the core Express server (`host/server.js`) that integrates with the @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK.

**Deliverables:**
- Express server listening on port 3000
- Serves static files from `web/` directory
- Claude Code SDK initialization with configurable working directory (env var)
- Single session management — maintain one Claude conversation
- Graceful shutdown handling

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- How does the @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK work? (research SDK docs/API)
- How to manage conversation continuity (session ID, message history)?
- What env vars are needed? (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, WORK_DIR, etc.)
