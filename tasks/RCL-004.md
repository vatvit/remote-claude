## Description

Implement the API layer for communication between web UI and host server.

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/command` — Accept `{ "command": "..." }`, send to Claude Code, return complete response
- `GET /api/status` — Return current state: idle, processing, error
- `GET /api/history` — Return conversation history for the current session

**Deliverables:**
- Route handlers in Express
- Request validation (reject empty commands, reject if already processing)
- JSON error responses with meaningful messages
- Verify: can send a command via curl and get a response

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Should there be a command queue or reject concurrent commands?
- Max command length limit?
- Should `/api/history` return all messages or paginate?
