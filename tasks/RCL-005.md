## Description

Build the static web UI (HTML/CSS/JS, no framework) with a chat-style interface.

**Deployment:** Must be deployable as a static site on GitHub Pages. No build step, no server-side rendering. The UI connects to the host server via a configurable API base URL (since it won't be same-origin with the host server).

**Deliverables:**
- `web/index.html` — page structure
- `web/style.css` — clean, simple styling
- `web/app.js` — command input, send to API, display responses
- Chat history display (scrollable, auto-scroll to bottom)
- Text input area with send button (also send on Enter / Ctrl+Enter)
- Loading indicator while waiting for response
- Status indicator (connected/processing/error)
- Responsive layout (works on mobile browsers too)

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Dark or light theme? Or follow system preference?
- Should the text input be single-line or multi-line (textarea)?
- Any keyboard shortcuts beyond Enter to send?
