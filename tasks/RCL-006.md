## Description

Render Claude's responses as formatted markdown with syntax-highlighted code blocks.

**Deliverables:**
- Markdown parsing (use a lightweight CDN library like marked.js or similar)
- Code block syntax highlighting (highlight.js or Prism via CDN)
- Proper rendering of: headers, bold/italic, lists, inline code, code blocks, links, tables
- Copy button on code blocks

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Which markdown library to use? (marked, markdown-it, showdown — all available via CDN)
- Which syntax highlighting library? (highlight.js vs Prism)
- Should links open in new tab?
