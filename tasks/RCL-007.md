## Description

Add Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming so users see Claude's response as it's generated, token by token.

This builds on top of the existing complete-result API (RCL-004). The web UI should use streaming by default and fall back gracefully.

**Deliverables:**
- `GET /api/stream` — SSE endpoint that streams Claude Code output events
- `POST /api/command` updated to optionally return via SSE instead of JSON
- Web UI connects to SSE and renders tokens incrementally
- Markdown re-renders as new tokens arrive (debounced)
- Connection auto-reconnect on drop

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Does the Claude Code SDK support streaming callbacks/events?
- How to handle markdown rendering mid-stream (partial code blocks, etc.)?
- Should the UI show a "streaming..." indicator differently from "processing..."?
