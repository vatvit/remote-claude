## Description

Separate admin/management UI served on port 8887 (host-side only). Provides visibility and control over the Remote Claude server.

**Features:**
- View active session info (session ID, start time, message count)
- View conversation history / live activity
- See connected client IPs
- IP whitelist management (allow/block clients)
- Select / change working directory (folder picker or input)
- Server status overview (uptime, memory, Claude Code process state)

**Technical notes:**
- Separate Express app or separate route mount on a second port
- Static HTML/CSS/JS like the client UI (no framework)
- Shares state with the main server (same process, different port)
- Could potentially restrict access to localhost only (since it's the host machine)

**Questions to clarify during implementation:**
- Should the admin UI be accessible only from localhost, or from WLAN too?
- IP whitelist: should it block at connection level or just at /api/command?
- Working directory change: hot-swap (reset session) or require server restart?
- Should admin UI show real-time streaming of Claude's output (live tail)?
- Any other admin actions needed? (kill running command, view logs, etc.)
