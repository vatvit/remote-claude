## Description

Deploy the web client UI (static HTML/JS/CSS from `web/`) as a GitHub Pages site, so it can be accessed without running the Docker host server locally.

## Requirements

- **Deploy method:** Serve from `/docs` on main branch. Copy web/ files to /docs/. No CI needed.
- **API URL config:** Via URL parameter `?api=http://host:8888`. No settings UI — keep it simple.
- `app.js` already reads `window.REMOTE_CLAUDE_API || ''` — update to also parse `?api=` query param.
- Static files (index.html, style.css, app.js) copied to `/docs/`.
- CDN deps (marked.js, highlight.js) already external — no build step.
- GitHub Pages configured to serve from `/docs` folder on `main` branch.
