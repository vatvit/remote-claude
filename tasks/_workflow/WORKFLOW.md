# Task Workflow

1. requirements - EARS specifications if needed
2. assessment - Check codebase readiness
3. architecture - Design decisions
4. tests - Test specifications (project-dependent)
5. subtasks - Break into sub-tickets
6. implementation - Write the code
7. tech-debt - Create debt tickets for shortcuts
8. reflection - Update CLAUDE.md and project docs with lessons learned

Skip steps that don't apply. Each step is a decision point.
